# Hi there! 👋

I am `Jakob`, a chef and hospitality expert turned into an IT student. 🔪👨‍🍳⚡🖥️

## 💡 I am currently interested in:
-  Web development (Node.js, Express, Vue.js)
-  Cybersecurity & penetration testing
-  Game development & simulations (Unity, ML Agents)
-  Data analysis & programming (Python)

## ✨ What motivates me:
- Building practical solutions from scratch
- Experimenting with new technologies and frameworks
- Constantly learning and improving my skills

Currently in my GitHub, I mainly share course milestones and experiments of new technologies. Feel free to explore, reach out if you have similar interests, or even if you want help perfecting a recipe! 🍳
